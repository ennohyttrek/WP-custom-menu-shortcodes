# WP Custom Menus Shortcodes

 This is an extremely simple WordPress plugin which I wrote in a quick&dirty way to solve a problem I had when working on a WordPress site: I needed one (or more) extra menus, which I could insert as an editor block. Coding an actual (Gutenberg) block is way beyond my coding skills, so I wrote this simpe plugin, which provides three custom menus/menu positions, to be isnerted by shortcode.
 
 It couzld be written in a much more elegant way, but it isn't and it does the job. If you want to use it, feel free to do so, but remember that by license I am not liable for any discomfort you, or your site, may suffer from as a result.
 
 Enjoy!
