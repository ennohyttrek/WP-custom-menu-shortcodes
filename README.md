# WP Custom Menus Shortcodes

 This is an extremely simple WordPress plugin which I wrote in a quick&dirty way to solve a problem I had when working on a WordPress site: I needed one (or more) extra menus, which I could insert as an editor block. Coding an actual (Gutenberg) block is way beyond my coding skills, so I wrote this simple plugin, which provides three custom menus/menu positions, to be inserted by shortcode.
 
 The menus will be rendered as standard lists with links. There is no CSS included with the plugin at this point. Please add your own in your theme's or child theme's stylesheet, or in the customizer custom CSS.
 
 The plugin could have been written in a much more elegant way, but it wasn't and it does it's job. If you want to use it, feel free to do so, but remember that by license I am not liable for any discomfort you, or your site, may suffer from as a result.
 
 Please also note, that there is a WP Editor navigation block in development by the WordPress developer team. At the moment that block is still in beta and only available when installing teh Gutenberg plugin, but once it is out of beta and part of the WP realease, my little plugin here might be obsolete.
 
 Enjoy!
